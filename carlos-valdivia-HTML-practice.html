    <h1>Stocks I'm Bullish On</h1>
    <h1>Hello everyone</h1> 
    <p>
      I believe their is great oppurtunity in the stock market right now. I
      beleive the EV market will boom in the next few years. The reason I am so
      bullish is due to the increasing action countries are doing in order to
      combat climate change. Articles like the ones below explain how countries
      like China and the US are making it a priority to cut back on emissions.
      Even though im bullish on the whole EV market, my two biggest positions
      are in NIO and CCIV(Lucid Motors).
    </p>
    <h2>NIO</h2>
    <p>NIO is a Chinese EV Company</p>
    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        China has the largest EV market in the world accounting for 44% of all
        the EVs in the world. That is around 4.5 million EVs. China also has the
        2nd highest annual growth rate of EV sales in the world at around 36%.
      </li>
      <li>
        NIO has battery swapping technology. NIO Power Swap 2.0 can
        automatically perform a battery swap in 3-5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Support from Chinese Government. Hefei city government has injected 7
        billion RMB of capital into NIO in 2019. This year, Hefei government and
        NIO have agreed to invest 50 billion RMB together to build a World-Class
        Smart EV Industrial Park.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deliveries. For the second quarter of 2021, NIO reports that it
        delivered 21,896 vehicles, a new quarterly record representing an
        increase of 111.9% year-over-year. As of June 30, 2021, NIO’s cumulative
        deliveries of its three available EVs have reached 117,597.
      </li>
      <li>
        International Expansion. NIO has planned to start expand internationally
        to Norway in September 2021. Norway has been chosen as 65% of 2021 new
        vehicles sales are expected to be EVs. Europe has the fastest EV sales
        growth in the world
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Competition. Although $NIO has said that it is not a direct competitor
        of Tesla, EVs' competition is no doubt heating up. $NIO has enjoyed a
        first mover advantage in premium EVs in China.
      </li>
      <li>
        Limitations of being a premium brand. NIO aims to become the electric
        version of Benz, BMW, or Audi. This may limit NIO's total addressable
        market. Benz, BMW and Audi each sold around 2 million vehicles per year
        and combine for around 10% of global car sales.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>CCIV(Lucid Motors)</h2>
    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Peter Rawlinson: CEO & CTO Previous work: - former VP of engineering at
        Tesla - chief engineer of Tesla Model S - also worked at Jaguar - 30
        years of experience Current work: - developing Lucid Air - responsible
        for creation and delivery of all Lucid products
      </li>
      <li>
        LucidMotors has set its Target on the Luxury as it knows it can be the
        first car to Launch with #500Mile Range. Which will be a great USP in
        the Luxury segment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Best in the Miles/KWH. Lucid Motors claims it has over 4.5 miles/kWh.
        That is .5 higher than the next EV comapny which is Tesla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Huge Potential. In terms valuation especially with high valued $TSLA,
        $NIO $XPEV, Lucid Motors seems to be valued very reasonable.
      </li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lucid has not deliveried a single car.</li>
      <li>Company went public this year. Investing on speculation</li>
    </ul>
